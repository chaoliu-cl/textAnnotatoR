Participant: It was definitely challenging at first. I think the biggest issues were setting up a proper workspace at home and establishing boundaries between work and personal life. It took me about a month to develop a routine that worked. Now, I actually prefer working remotely. I'm more productive without office distractions, and I save two hours daily by not commuting.  Interviewer: What tools or resources have been most helpful?  Participant: Video conferencing has been essential - we use Zoom for all our meetings. We also rely heavily on Slack for quick communications and Asana for project management. My company provided a second monitor and an ergonomic chair, which made a huge difference in my physical comfort. I'd say the technology was easy to adapt to, but the social aspects were harder. It's difficult to replace those impromptu conversations by the coffee machine.  Interviewer: How has remote work affected your work-life balance?  Participant: It's a double-edged sword. I have more flexibility and time with family, but it's also harder to disconnect. Sometimes I find myself checking emails well into the evening, which wasn't a habit before. I've had to be intentional about setting working hours and sticking to them.
