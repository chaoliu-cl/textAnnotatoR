\title{Generate Code Co-occurrence Network}
\usage{
generate_code_co_occurrence_network(annotations)
}
\arguments{
\item{annotations}{Data frame containing columns:
\itemize{
\item code: Factor or character vector of code names
\item \link{other columns are ignored}
}}
}
\value{
A recorded plot object (from grDevices::recordPlot) showing the
co-occurrence network. If 0 or 1 codes are present, returns a simple
plot with an appropriate message.
}
\description{
Creates a network visualization showing how different codes co-occur in the text.
Codes are represented as nodes, and lines between nodes indicate co-occurrence,
with line thickness proportional to co-occurrence frequency.
}
\examples{
# Create sample annotations with co-occurring codes
annotations <- data.frame(
  code = c("Code1", "Code2", "Code1", "Code2", "Code3"),
  start = c(1, 1, 10, 10, 20),
  end = c(5, 5, 15, 15, 25),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)

# Generate and display the network
network <- generate_code_co_occurrence_network(annotations)

# Example with single code
single_code <- data.frame(
  code = "Code1",
  start = 1,
  end = 5,
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)
single_network <- generate_code_co_occurrence_network(single_code)
}
