\title{Calculate code co-occurrences using unit-based analysis}
\usage{
calculate_co_occurrences(annotations, unit = "paragraph", text = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{annotations}{Data frame containing annotations with columns:
\itemize{
\item start: numeric, starting position of annotation
\item end: numeric, ending position of annotation
\item code: character, code identifier
}}

\item{unit}{Character string specifying analytical unit: "sentence", "paragraph", or "document"}

\item{text}{Optional character string containing the original text for accurate unit parsing}
}
\value{
Table object containing frequencies of code pairs that co-occur,
with code pair names as "code1 & code2"
}
\description{
Analyzes text annotations to identify and count instances where different codes
appear together within the same analytical unit (sentence, paragraph, or document).
This replaces the character-overlap approach with the standard unit-based methodology.
}
\details{
Co-occurrences are identified by finding codes that appear within the same
analytical unit. The function parses text into units and maps annotations
to those units, then counts co-occurrence patterns.
