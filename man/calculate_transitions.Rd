\title{Calculate transitions between consecutive codes (updated)}
\usage{
calculate_transitions(annotations, unit = "paragraph", text = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{annotations}{Data frame containing annotations with columns:
\itemize{
\item start: numeric, starting position of annotation
\item end: numeric, ending position of annotation
\item code: character, code identifier
}}

\item{unit}{Character string specifying analytical unit for transition analysis}

\item{text}{Optional character string for accurate unit parsing}
}
\value{
List where each element is a named vector containing:
\itemize{
\item from: Character string of the source code
\item to: Character string of the target code
}
}
\description{
Analyzes the sequence of code applications to identify transitions between
consecutive codes based on analytical units rather than strict position.
}
\details{
Transitions are identified by analyzing the sequence of analytical units
and tracking code changes between adjacent units.
